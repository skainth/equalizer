This is a demo of an equalizer. The sliders used in this demo are created from scratch without using any third party library.

The sliders can only be interacted with mouse, as keyboard handling is not implemented for this demo.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The preset selector has been built [http://fraserxu.me/react-dropdown/](http://fraserxu.me/react-dropdown/)

This demo works well on Chrome and Safari on Mac. It has not been tested on IE and Edge browsers.


A live demo of the project is available at [https://equalizer-sk.herokuapp.com/](https://equalizer-sk.herokuapp.com/)
 

To run the project locally, install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and clone or download the master branch from this repository.

Then open the download directory in a Terminal.

In the terminal, issue the following command to install the dependencies
### `yarn install`

Next, run the project via the following command
### `yarn start`

The above should start the application on port 3000 (or some other port if port 3000 is busy).
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
